# Amazon S3 Basics<a name="AmazonS3Basics"></a>

To get the most out of Amazon S3, you need to understand a few simple concepts\. Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets\. An object consists of a file and optionally any metadata that describes that file\. 

To store an object in Amazon S3, you upload the file you want to store to a bucket\. When you upload a file, you can set permissions on the object as well as any metadata\. 

Buckets are the containers for objects\. You can have one or more buckets\. For each bucket, you can control access to it \(who can create, delete, and list objects in the bucket\), view access logs for it and its objects, and choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents\.
